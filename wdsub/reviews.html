  <h2 class="heading">The Hobbit</h2>
  <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit" target="_blank">The Hobbit</a>  is a great movie that knows when not to be to serious..and when not to be too comical.The acting by all is amazing. The cgi was for the most part quality ..but i hated that they photoshopped? or blurred Legolas's face to make him seem younger..he is quite handsome without the foolish blurrriness.I love LOTR and The Hobbit so i may be biased but i think the 6 movies are the most epic awsome movies ever made.Yes the movie is long but an epic saga like this needs the time.Gandalf and Bilbo characters carry the movie smoothly along.The Dwarves are funny and heaertwarming...the plot and their acting skills together i feel make the Hobbit series a c lassic.The elves and the elven King..my favorite characters in all the movies..did not dissapoint! The Woodland elven king is such a powerful character on his own..id love to see more movies made about the elves..beautiful settings...can I find any thng wriong with this movie?Id have left the stone giants scene out...but if its true to the novel then so be it!</p>

  <h2 class="heading">Animal Farm</h2>
  <p>Animal Farm tells the story of farm animals who rebel against their oppressive human master in hope for a better life. The story seems simple at first, but as it unfolds, the plot thickens, becoming more intriguing and compelling with every chapter. Exploring corruption, manipulation, political recession, totalitarianism, and communism, George Orwell's allegorical novel manages to depict a whole era. Recreating the Soviet age in a seemingly playful, fabled world, Animal Farm makes for a great read with a stunning lesson—still relevant over 76 years after the novel's publishing. In a world where corruption and dictators are always on the horizon, the story is a must-read in order to educate people of the dangers of a naive and ignorant common-class. It is critical for anyone willing to help make a change in the political world and fight for freedom, and offers for a wonderful experience for casual readers and historians alike, as the novel holds much historical significance as well. On the whole, George Orwell's Animal Farm is a masterpiece with an amazing plot and ever-relevant lesson, and has undoubtedly earned its author a spot among the best authors of the 20th century.</p>

  <h2 class="heading">Narritive of the life of Fredrik Douglass</h2>
  <p>The book’s name is, “The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.” The significance of this book was to tell the story of how it was like to be a slave to the people up north Who was new to America and didn’t know anything about slavery, like the Irish. Fredrick was born as Fredrick Augustus Washington Bailey, in Maryland, near Easton in Talbot County. His birthday is unknown but he was born in the years of 1817 or 1818. He was born into being a field slave. When he grew up at the age of seven or eight, he was sent to be a house servant, there he learned how to read and write. He escaped in the year of 1838. When he escaped, he went to New York then found his wife, Anna Murray Douglass, then later, Helen Pitts Douglas. The story gives meaningful lessons. Lessons such as how my generation, generation Z, takes going to school for granted. We aren't thankful that we can go to school freely and without having to worry about how other people might see us as useless if we know how to read and write. Many slaves, such as Frederick Douglass, would put his life on the line just to learn the alphabet. In this book Frederick also mentions how if you were a slave and you knew how to read and write, you weren’t useful anymore. He was determined on how to educate himself and read, and write, which also goes to show that when you are determined to learn how to do something, or doing something, don’t ever let someone else take that determination and passion away from you. Even though Frederick Douglass was not allowed to learn how to read or write, he would still find ways to learn. When he was a house servant and when he had to take his master's son to school, he would make friends with white kids so that they can teach him how to read and write little by little. Sadly, situations were mostly young, black people can’t read or write are still an ongoing issue to this day. In low income neighborhoods where the majority of black people, Hispanic people, and many other races other than white, can’t get an education, or have a lack of education. Since many black people, still to this day, can’t get a job just because of their skin color, can't afford a nice neighborhood for their children, and so the children are forced to go to a school where unqualified teachers work. In the school, so many teachers don’t really bother to educate or pay attention to the kids who need a bit of more help on learning a specific type of subject. This all leads back to the time of slavery, and segregation. It is an ongoing problem in America and in Frederick Douglass his book he shows how the problems back then still affect black Americans today.</p>
